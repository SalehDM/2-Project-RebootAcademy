üìö **Eco ReBoot: CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Analysis Project**

üåç **Project Overview**

Eco ReBoot is an environmental organization focused on investigating human impacts on climate change.
Our team was tasked with analyzing an extensive dataset covering CO‚ÇÇ emissions since industrialization, including sectoral contributions, energy source trends, and correlations with global temperature changes.

This repository documents our work process, analyses, and findings aimed at supporting Eco ReBoot's research on climate mitigation strategies.

üìë **Project Objectives**

Analyze the evolution of global CO‚ÇÇ emissions and identify significant shifts.

Determine the sectors most responsible for emissions and track their evolution.

Investigate the dominance of energy sources over time.

Correlate political, historical, and technological events with emission trends.

Propose strategies based on shared responsibility to reduce emissions.
